**Lab5**

By: Anthony Tlatenchi

This program is designed to read in a csv fill from Spotify charts the one I chose is a viral 50 chart from the week of August 27 of this year which is same file used in Lab2. Using this csv file the program takes on the task of receiving all the artist that appear and sending those results to a output file sorted alphabetically and with no duplicates. The difference between this weeks Lab3 and Lab2 is the way the elements are being stored. In Lab2 we used an array to store the artist names but in Lab3 you will see the implementation of linked list in order to store the artist names.


**Installation**

If you wish to compile my program I would recommend using an IDE with Java 8 because that is what I used to create the program and from there you can simply paste the code into the IDE. To get a csv file you can go to Spotify Charts or use the one provided in the Data folder.

**Dependencies**

* Java 8

**Folder Structure**
